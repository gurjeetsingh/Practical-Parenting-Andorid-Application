Code Style Guide
(Part of the content consulted by the java style guide instructor provide)

Naming:

1.	Variable: Use a word for the name of variables. If multiple words are needed for a variable, the first letter of the first word of the name is lowercase, the remaining words are uppercase. ie camelCase.

    Example:
    a)	Bad: childname, ChildN, c_n.
    b)	Good: childName.


2.	Function: Function names should describe what the function does. The first letter of the first word of the name is lowercase, the remaining words are uppercase.

    Example:
    a)	Bad: ChooseChild(), choosechild(), cc().
    b)	Good: chooseChild().


3.	Class: Every word in class name should be capitalized.

    Example:
    a)	Bad: Childmanagr, childM, CM.
    b)	Good: ChildManager.


4.	ID: The words of xml layout IDs are all lowercase and connected by "_".

    Example:
    a)	Bad: ChildList, childlist, cl.
    b)	Good: child_list.



Braces:

1.	Opening brace is at the end of the enclosing statement; closing brace is on its own line

    Example:
    a)	Bad:
        for ( int i = 0; i < size; i++)
        {
            ……
        }

    b)	Good:
        for ( int i = 0; i < size; i++){
            ……
        }



Code formatting

1.	Solve problems or functionality requirements using a function. It is confusing if the code is not in a function. If a function cannot be used, add additional comments to describe the code functionality.


2.	Format code for readability and keep at an appropriate length.

    Example:
    a)	Bad:
        if (children.getIndex() != 10 && children.getIndex() != 15 && children.getIndex() != 20 && children.getIndex() > 3) {
            ……
        }
    b)	Good:
        if (children.getIndex() != 10
        && children.getIndex() != 15
        && children.getIndex() != 20
        && children.getIndex() > 3) {
                    ……
        }


3.	The order of functions should be in the order you call them. This makes it easier for other member of the team to find them.

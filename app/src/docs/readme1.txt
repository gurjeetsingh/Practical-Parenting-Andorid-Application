Practical Parent

Iteration 1

Team Lava:
Gurjeet Singh(Scrum Master)
Yuchun He(Repo Manager)
Yuhan He(Team Member)
Ahmad As Sami(Product Owner)

We have implemented all user stories required for Iteration 1.
For the Timeout Timer Activity Screen, we used a different, calm colour scheme
so that it is easy on the eyes and calming to parent while setting a timer.

Iteration 2
----------
Team Lava:
Ahmad As Sami(Scrum Master)
Yuhan He(Repo Manager)
Yuchun He(Product Owner)
Gurjeet Singh(Team Member)

We have implemented all user stories required for Iteration 2.

For our Edit Task Screen, we have included a small pencil to make it easy to add
and edit tasks. Tapping on a task reveals the picture of the child and a done button.

ABOUT THE CHILD DETAILS CAMERA
------------------------------
About the Camera, we tested our application on two phones outside, and we found our Take picture
with camera works perfectly on a android phone. However, the android virtual device flips
the picture on its side. This is a common issue with some Android Virtual Devices. After
speaking with the professor about this, he said to include a note in our readme file, that
our camera works on a normal Android phone.

We have also done plenty of code reviews on our merge requests and have
reviewed each other's code, and also done pair programming(virtually) as our effort
to work as a team.

Our application has been extensively tested for all User Stories with
Google Pixel 2 API 24.
